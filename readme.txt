oops, looks like i just released something i probably shouldnt have had
enables you to join online with TMI loaded
official mode is kept disabled, whatever it might be doing to replays, was also kept

personaly i wont use this, i just wanted to try if i could it, you also shouldnt use it, keep it fair

tested on TMI 1.0.9 and TMUF v2010-03-15 (2.11.26) (steam)
